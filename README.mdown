Bounce
======

Compiling:
    $ make

Remove the generated artifacts:
    $ make clean

Usage:
    $ ./bounce [num-balls]

`num-balls` is the number of balls that you want in the scene. The default is to bounce 1 ball.

Note that for now, the terminal size is assumed to be 80x25. The dimensions can be configured in the source file. Eventually dynamic setting of the terminal size may be implemented.
