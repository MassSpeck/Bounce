Bounce
======

Compiling:
    $ gcc -Wall -pedantic bounce.c -o bounce

Usage:
    $ ./bounce [num-balls]

num-balls is the number of balls that you want to bounce. The 
default is to bounce 1 ball.

Note that for now, the terminal size is assumed to be 80x25. The
dimensions can be configured in the source file. Eventually 
dynamic setting of the terminal size may be implemented.
